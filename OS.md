These skills are crucial for creating efficient and powerful shell programs. In the next sessions, we will explore more advanced topics and practical applications of shell scripting.


### Process:

#### Definition:
A process is an executing instance of a computer program. It can be seen as a program in execution. A process has its memory space, system resources, and a set of data associated with it.

#### Attributes of a Process:
- **Program Counter (PC):** Indicates the address of the next instruction to be executed.
- **Registers:** Temporary data storage.
- **Memory Space:** Contains the program, data, and stack.
- **Status Flags:** Indicate the status of the process (running, ready, waiting).
- **File Descriptors:** Pointers to open files.

### Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Processes:

#### Preemptive Processes:
- A preemptive process can be interrupted in the middle of its execution, and its state is saved.
- It allows for multitasking and ensures fair CPU allocation.

#### Non-Preemptive Processes:
- A non-preemptive process cannot be interrupted until it completes its execution or voluntarily gives up control.
- Simpler to implement but may lead to uneven resource distribution.

### Process Management and Life Cycle:

#### Process Management:
- Involves creating, scheduling, terminating, and managing processes during their execution.

#### Process Life Cycle:
1. **Creation:** A new process is created.
2. **Running:** The process is actively being executed.
3. **Waiting:** The process is waiting for an event or resource.
4. **Termination:** The process has completed its execution.

### Schedulers - Short Term, Medium-term, and Long Term:

#### Short-Term Scheduler (CPU Scheduler):
- Selects which process to execute from the ready queue.
- Manages CPU allocation for a short duration.

#### Medium-Term Scheduler:
- Swaps processes in and out of the main memory.
- Manages the degree of multiprogramming.

#### Long-Term Scheduler (Job Scheduler):
- Selects which processes should be brought into the ready queue from the job pool.
- Decides the degree of multiprogramming.

### Process Scheduling Algorithms:

#### FCFS (First-Come-First-Serve):
- Executes processes in the order they arrive.
- Simple but may lead to the "convoy effect."

#### Shortest Job First (SJF):
- Executes the process with the shortest burst time first.
- Minimizes waiting time but requires predicting burst times.

#### Priority Scheduling:
- Assigns priorities to processes; higher priority processes execute first.
- Can suffer from priority inversion and starvation.

#### Round Robin (RR):
- Assigns each process a fixed time slice (quantum).
- Implements a circular queue to rotate processes.

#### Queue:
- A method of organizing processes based on certain criteria.

#### Belady's Anomaly:
- Anomaly where increasing the number of frames in a page table can lead to more page faults.

### Examples Associated with Scheduling Algorithms:

#### Turnaround Time:
- The total time taken by a process to complete, from submission to termination.
- Examples will demonstrate the impact of scheduling algorithms on turnaround time.

### Process Creation using fork, waitpid, and exec System Calls:

#### fork System Call:
- Creates a new process (child) that is a copy of the current process (parent).

#### waitpid System Call:
- Parent process waits for the termination of the child process.

#### exec System Call:
- Replaces the current process image with a new one.

### Parent and Child Processes:

- **Parent Process:** The original process that creates one or more child processes.
- **Child Process:** A process created by a parent process.

### Orphan and Zombie Processes:

#### Orphan Process:
- A child process whose parent process has terminated.
- Adopted by the init process.

#### Zombie Process:
- A process that has terminated but its exit status is still kept in the process table.
- Will be removed completely after the parent acknowledges the child's termination.

Understanding these concepts is essential for effective process management and scheduling in an operating system. The examples provided will illustrate the practical implications of different scheduling algorithms.


### Memory Management:

#### Different Types of Memories:

1. **Primary Memory (RAM):**
   - Volatile memory used for active program and data storage.
   - Directly accessible by the CPU.

2. **Secondary Memory (e.g., Hard Drive, SSD):**
   - Non-volatile storage used for long-term data storage.
   - Slower access compared to primary memory.

3. **Cache Memory:**
   - High-speed volatile memory located between the RAM and the CPU.
   - Temporarily stores frequently accessed data.

#### Need for Memory Management:

- Efficiently manages the computer's memory resources, ensuring optimal utilization and allocation to processes.
- Facilitates smooth execution of programs and prevents memory-related issues.

### Continuous and Dynamic Allocation:

#### Continuous Allocation:
- Allocates a single contiguous block of memory to a process.
- Simpler but may lead to fragmentation issues.

#### Dynamic Allocation:
- Allocates memory dynamically as needed.
- Reduces fragmentation but requires more complex management.

### Memory Allocation Algorithms:

#### First Fit, Best Fit, Worst Fit:
- **First Fit:** Allocates the first available block large enough to accommodate the process.
- **Best Fit:** Allocates the smallest available block that fits the process.
- **Worst Fit:** Allocates the largest available block.

#### Compaction:
- Reorganizes memory to eliminate fragmentation.
- Combines free memory blocks to create larger contiguous blocks.

#### Internal and External Fragmentation:

- **Internal Fragmentation:** Wasted memory within a partition due to the allocation of more memory than needed.
- **External Fragmentation:** Unallocated memory scattered throughout the system, making it challenging to allocate large contiguous blocks.

### Segmentation:

#### What is Segmentation:
- Divides the main memory into segments based on logical criteria (e.g., code, data, stack).

#### Hardware Requirements for Segmentation:
- Segment Table: Maps logical addresses to physical addresses.
- Base Register: Holds the starting address of the segment.
- Limit Register: Specifies the size of the segment.

#### Segmentation Table and its Interpretation:
- The segmentation table holds the base and limit values for each segment.
- Interpretation involves adding the base value to the logical address to get the physical address.

### Paging:

#### What is Paging:
- Divides physical memory and processes into fixed-size blocks (pages).
- Simplifies memory allocation and reduces external fragmentation.

#### Hardware Requirements for Paging:
- Page Table: Maps logical page numbers to physical frame numbers.
- Page Frame: A fixed-size contiguous block in physical memory.

#### Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB):
- A cache that stores recently accessed page table entries for faster address translation.

### Concept of Dirty Bit:

- A flag associated with a page indicating whether the page has been modified since it was last loaded into memory.
- Helps in optimizing write-back policies to secondary storage.

### Shared Pages and Reentrant Code:

#### Shared Pages:
- Allows multiple processes to share the same physical memory space.
- Enhances memory utilization.

#### Reentrant Code:
- Code that can be safely shared among multiple processes without causing conflicts.

### Throttling:

- Throttling involves controlling the rate at which a process can access or use resources.
- Used to prevent resource exhaustion and ensure fair resource allocation.

Understanding memory management is crucial for optimizing system performance, preventing fragmentation issues, and ensuring efficient resource utilization. Concepts such as segmentation, paging, and allocation algorithms play a vital role in achieving these goals.


### Virtual Memory:

#### What is Virtual Memory:

- **Definition:** Virtual memory is a memory management technique that provides an "idealized abstraction of the storage resources that are actually available on a given machine."
  
- **Purpose:** It extends the available physical memory by using disk space as a temporary storage for data.

### Demand Paging:

#### Demand Paging:

- **Definition:** Demand paging is a method of virtual memory management in which pages are transferred to main memory only when demanded by the program.

- **Key Features:**
  - Only the necessary pages are brought into memory.
  - Improves overall system efficiency and reduces the need for extensive physical memory.

### Page Faults:

#### Page Faults:

- **Definition:** A page fault occurs when a program attempts to access a portion of memory that is not currently in physical RAM.

- **Handling Page Faults:**
  - The operating system must fetch the required page from the backing store (disk) into physical memory.
  - Involves a context switch to the operating system's memory manager.

### Page Replacement Algorithms:

#### Page Replacement Algorithms:

- **Purpose:** When a page fault occurs and there is no available space in physical memory, the operating system must choose which page to replace with the newly demanded page.

#### Common Page Replacement Algorithms:

1. **Optimal Page Replacement:**
   - Replaces the page that will not be used for the longest period.
   - Provides a baseline for evaluating other algorithms but is not practical due to its future knowledge requirement.

2. **FIFO (First-In-First-Out):**
   - Replaces the oldest page in memory.
   - Simple and easy to implement but may suffer from the "Belady's Anomaly."

3. **LRU (Least Recently Used):**
   - Replaces the page that has not been used for the longest time.
   - Requires maintaining a usage history for each page, which can be resource-intensive.

4. **Clock (or Second-Chance):**
   - Similar to FIFO but uses a clock-like mechanism.
   - A "hand" points to the next page in a circular queue, and it is replaced if not recently used.

5. **LRU Approximations (e.g., Aging):**
   - Uses a counter to approximate the time since a page was last used.
   - Low-cost implementation compared to true LRU.

6. **Random Page Replacement:**
   - Randomly selects a page for replacement.
   - Simple but not necessarily efficient.

### Summary:

Virtual memory allows efficient utilization of memory resources by bringing only necessary pages into physical memory on demand. 
Demand paging reduces the initial loading time and helps in better utilizing available storage. 
Page faults occur when a required page is not in physical memory, leading to a context switch to the operating system.

Page replacement algorithms are essential for deciding which page to evict when a page fault occurs. 
Common algorithms include FIFO, LRU, Clock, and random page replacement. Each algorithm has its advantages and trade-offs, and their effectiveness depends on the application's memory access patterns.


### Deadlock:

#### Definition:

- **Deadlock:** 
In computer science, a deadlock is a state in which each member of a group of processes is waiting for another member to release a resource.

#### Necessary Conditions of Deadlock:

1. **Mutual Exclusion:**
   - At least one resource must be held in a non-sharable mode.
   - Only one process can use the resource at a time.

2. **Hold and Wait:**
   - A process must be holding at least one resource while waiting for additional resources acquired by other processes.

3. **No Preemption:**
   - Resources cannot be forcibly taken away from a process; they must be released voluntarily.

4. **Circular Wait:**
   - A circular chain of processes, each waiting for a resource held by the next process in the chain.

#### Deadlock Prevention and Avoidance:

- **Prevention:**
  - Address one of the necessary conditions to ensure that a deadlock cannot occur.
  - For example, impose a total ordering of resource types.

- **Avoidance:**
  - Use a dynamic allocation scheme to ensure that the system will never enter an unsafe state.
  - The system checks for the possibility of a deadlock before allocating resources.

### Semaphore:

#### Semaphore:

- **Definition:** 
A semaphore is a variable or abstract data type used for controlling access to a common resource by multiple processes in a concurrent system.


- **Operations:**
  - `wait()` (or `P()`): Decrements the semaphore value.
  - `signal()` (or `V()`): Increments the semaphore value.

### Mutex:

#### Mutex (Mutual Exclusion):

- **Definition:** A mutex is a synchronization primitive that grants exclusive access to the shared resource to only one process at a time.

- **Operations:**
  - `lock()`: Acquires the mutex.
  - `unlock()`: Releases the mutex.

### Producer-Consumer Problem:

#### Producer-Consumer Problem:

- **Scenario:** Multiple producers and consumers share a fixed-size buffer.
- **Challenge:** Coordinate access to the buffer to prevent data corruption.

### Deadlock vs Starvation:

#### Deadlock:

- **Definition:** A state where processes cannot proceed because each is waiting for the other to release a resource.

#### Starvation:

- **Definition:** A condition where a process is perpetually denied necessary resources, even though the resources are available in the system.

#### Differences:

- **Deadlock:** Involves a circular wait among processes, resulting in a complete halt.
- **Starvation:** Involves a process being denied resources but not necessarily leading to a complete halt.

Understanding and managing deadlocks are critical for the design of concurrent systems. 
Prevention and avoidance strategies aim to eliminate or dynamically manage the necessary conditions for a deadlock. 
Semaphores and mutexes provide synchronization mechanisms to coordinate access to shared resources. 
The producer-consumer problem is a classic example highlighting the importance of synchronization in concurrent systems. 
Deadlock and starvation are related but distinct concepts, with deadlock involving circular waits and a complete halt, 
while starvation implies a continuous denial of resources.
